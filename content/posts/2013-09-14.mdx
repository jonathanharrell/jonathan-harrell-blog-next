Living beside Nakdong River.<br/>
Sometimes I see mist in the mountains.<br/>
Other days, the sun shines through a hazy sky.

![A view from a tunnel under a bridge. Sunlight illuminates the path, with water flowing through the channel. Vines hang from the top of the tunnel, framing the view of the bridge and the mountains beyond.](../../assets/photos/20130914-IMG_0013.jpg)

![The interior of a concrete tunnel with large support pillars, some of which are covered in graffiti. The ground is rocky, with a small stream running through, illuminated by a warm glow from the light.](../../assets/photos/20130524-IMG_7329.jpg)
