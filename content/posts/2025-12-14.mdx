![Snow-covered lakeshore with overhanging trees and a partially frozen lake under a gray winter sky. Snow blankets the branches and the shoreline, while thin ice with scattered patches forms along the water’s edge.](/assets/photos/20251214-IMG_7072.jpg)

![Snow-laden tree branches in the foreground frame a view of a frozen lake where hundreds of ducks or geese are clustered on the ice. A snowy treeline and a small pavilion stand in the distance beneath an overcast sky.](/assets/photos/20251214-IMG_7076.jpg)
