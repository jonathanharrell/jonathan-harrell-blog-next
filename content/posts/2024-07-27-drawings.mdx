> Why does a beautiful sketch accord greater pleasure than a beautiful painting? Because it has more life and fewer forms… Perhaps we find sketches so attractive only because, being somewhat indeterminate, they allow more liberty to our imagination….

  ![A soft, monochrome drawing of a rocky, mountainous landscape. Lightly textured with gentle shadows and delicate vegetation, the scene feels peaceful and atmospheric.](/assets/art/20240727-IMG_9867.jpg "<i>Study of River and Rocks</i>, by Cornelis van Poelenburch")
