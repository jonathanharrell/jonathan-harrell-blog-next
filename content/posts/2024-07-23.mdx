  ![A surreal illustration of a human profile in muted tones, with a flock of white birds emerging from the figure’s head, each bird seemingly representing a part of the person’s hair. The birds appear to fly outward, blending into the background, creating a dreamlike effect. The text at the top reads "Seminarium Ekologiczne, Darłowo 1989, Fundacja Biblioteka Ekologiczna," indicating this was created for an ecological seminar. The soft, ethereal colors and blending of human and bird forms suggest themes of nature, consciousness, and environmental awareness.](/assets/art/20240723-ecological-seminar.jpg "<i>Ecological Seminar</i>, by Eidrigevicius Stasys")
