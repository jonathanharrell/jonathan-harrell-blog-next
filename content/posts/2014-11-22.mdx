There was a haze over the city.<br/>
I couldn’t see you from where you stood,<br/>
Right there in front of me.<br/>
Hold out your hand, I said,<br/>
Let me see where you are.<br/>
Something appeared—<br/>
A shadow like a face in the smog—<br/>
But I wasn’t sure it was you.<br/>
Had I forgotten already<br/>
What you looked like?<br/>
Had I forgotten how to speak to you<br/>
In a language you would understand?
