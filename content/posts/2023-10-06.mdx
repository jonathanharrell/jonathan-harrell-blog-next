I sat in the woods so long<br/>
I became something else.<br/>
My skin split open,<br/>
My bones grew roots,<br/>
My hair became a tangle of kudzu.<br/>
I looked into the water to see my reflection,<br/>
But I didnâ€™t recognize what I saw.<br/>
My eyes were algae-covered wells,<br/>
My mouth a nesting hole.<br/>
When I tried to speak, no words came out,<br/>
Only the quiet whispering<br/>
Of a gentle wind through the trees.
