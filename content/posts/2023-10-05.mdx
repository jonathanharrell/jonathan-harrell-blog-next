![This image depicts a foggy coastal scene, where the mist blends the horizon with the sea, creating a mysterious and serene atmosphere. In the foreground, jagged, layered rock formations stretch toward the water, their textures visible despite the mist. The rocks have a weathered, striped appearance, shaped by the forces of nature over time. Gentle waves break against the shore, but the fog obscures much of the distance, giving the scene a sense of calm isolation. The surrounding greenery, including shrubs and small plants, adds a touch of color to the muted tones of the rocky coastline.](../../assets/photos/20231005-IMG_7359.jpg)
