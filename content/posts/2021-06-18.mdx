The city left behind a skeleton of concrete,<br/>
Ribs that became a jungle of glass.<br/>
Somewhere there is still a tended path<br/>
Through a garden of old ideas.<br/>
Remember all the dreams we used to have?<br/>
Those visions of a world built so perfectly<br/>
Out of lithium and polyethylene?<br/><br/>
Sit for a while,<br/>
Stare at the ground soaked through with cobalt rain.<br/>
If you cut through the skin of the new trees,<br/>
You will find metal veins.<br/>
The crabs at your feet, brilliant blue,<br/>
Are not for eating.<br/><br/>
Nature moves on, you see,<br/>
But it is not the same.<br/>
I want to weep when I say it, but<br/>
This world is no longer for us.
