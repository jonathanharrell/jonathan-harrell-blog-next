A mist sits over the skeleton woods,<br/>
Where dead trees lie like bones,<br/>
Old trunks like spinesâ€”bent, broken,<br/>
A tibia, a femur, a ribcage of branches.<br/><br/>
A mist lies over the ocean, too.<br/>
The wave spray is a misting breath,<br/>
Rising from the water, to fall again,<br/>
Giving salty moisture to the dead.
