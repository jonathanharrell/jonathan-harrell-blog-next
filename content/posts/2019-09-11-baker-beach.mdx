A mist sits over the skeleton woods,<br/>
Where dead trees lie like bones,<br/>
Old trunks like spines—bent, broken,<br/>
A tibia, a femur, a ribcage of branches.<br/><br/>
A mist lies over the ocean, too.<br/>
The wave spray is a misting breath,<br/>
Rising from the water, to fall again,<br/>
Giving salty moisture to the dead.

The mist in the background gives the scene a mysterious, eerie atmosphere.](/assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2772.jpg)

![A landscape of rolling sand dunes covered in patches of green vegetation. The scene is slightly obscured by fog, creating a soft, muted atmosphere. The vegetation varies in height, with low shrubs and taller trees in the background, blending into the mist.](/assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2783.jpg)

![A concrete military bunker structure surrounded by low shrubs and greenery on a sunny day. The structure has stairs leading up to a flat roof with railings and a ladder. The scene evokes a contrast between the harsh, industrial nature of the bunker and the soft, natural landscape around it.](/assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2831.jpg)

![A foggy forest scene with tall, thin trees scattered across a grassy hill. The mist rolls through the trees, creating a moody, ethereal atmosphere. The branches of the trees are silhouetted against the dense fog, adding a sense of mystery to the landscape.](/assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2808.jpg)
