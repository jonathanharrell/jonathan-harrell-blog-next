![An empty parking garage with a dimly lit, industrial atmosphere, illuminated by a bright green fluorescent light hanging from the ceiling. The green light casts an eerie glow over the concrete walls and floors. In the foreground, a barrier arm is partially visible, and a small side door is open to the left. The muted colors and shadows create a stark, almost unsettling feeling within the enclosed space.](/assets/photos/20200308-IMG_3587.jpg)
