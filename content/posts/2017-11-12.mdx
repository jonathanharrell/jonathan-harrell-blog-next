![Abstract artwork featuring a dark, almost black background. Minimalist geometric shapes and lines form a highly stylized face with two small red circular shapes representing eyes, a thin yellow line outlining the nose, and a red square suggesting a mouth. Additional abstract elements, like a red half-circle near the top and a small ladder-like structure near the bottom, contribute to the surreal and balanced composition.](/assets/art/20171112-portrait-of-an-equilibrist.jpg "<i>Portrait of an Equilibrist</i>, by Paul Klee")
