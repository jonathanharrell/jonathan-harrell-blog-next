Winter beauty on Geumjeong Mountain.

![This image captures a rugged mountainous landscape with prominent rock formations in the foreground. The jagged cliffs and large boulders dominate the left side of the frame, while rolling hills with sparse vegetation extend into the background. The distant mountains are layered with a faint haze, giving the scene a sense of vastness and depth. The dry, brownish tones of the vegetation suggest that the photo may have been taken during a cooler or drier season. The contrast between the rocky cliffs and the softer, distant hills adds a dynamic quality to the landscape.](../../assets/photos/20130119-IMG_5858.jpg)

![This image shows a mountainous landscape with rocky terrain in the foreground and a misty, distant view of hills or mountains in the background. Sparse trees with bare branches frame the rocky outcrop, giving it a sense of natural isolation and calm. The atmosphere seems hazy, possibly from fog or mist, with city buildings faintly visible in the distance, adding a contrast between nature and urban life.](../../assets/photos/20130119-IMG_5838.jpg)
