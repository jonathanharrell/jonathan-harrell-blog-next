Sit little spirit,<br/>
Sit and think of the elder days,<br/>
When the world was yours.

![A lush, tropical scene featuring a small pond surrounded by dense greenery, including ferns, moss, and palm trees. In the center of the image, a serene white sculpture of a seated figure rests on a moss-covered rock by the waterâ€™s edge. Bright orange fish swim in the calm pond, adding a splash of color to the tranquil setting. The vibrant plants and peaceful atmosphere create a secluded, meditative garden scene.](/assets/photos/20200208-IMG_3526.jpg)
