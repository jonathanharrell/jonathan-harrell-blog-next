From the Noguchi Museum, New York:

![A tall, monolithic stone sculpture with a mix of rough, jagged surfaces and smoother, more polished sections. The piece appears to depict a face or abstract figure emerging from the stone, suggesting themes of transformation or release.](/assets/art/20220424-break-through-capestrano.jpg "<i>Break Through Capestrano</i>, by Isamu Noguchi")

![A large, angular stone sculpture that mimics the flowing, graceful movements of a dancer. The textured surface evokes the form of a human figure, but the abstract lines and geometric shapes suggest a more modern, interpretive representation of dance and movement.](/assets/art/20220424-indian-dancer.jpg "<i>Indian Dancer</i>, by Isamu Noguchi")

![An abstract stone sculpture placed in a garden, characterized by its rough, natural texture on one side and smooth, rounded surfaces on the other. A circular void is carved into the center of the sculpture, adding a contemplative element of space within the dense material.](/assets/art/20220424-core.jpg "<i>Core</i>, by Isamu Noguchi")

![A close-up view looking down into a circular, stone opening. The interior is smooth with faint ridges, giving a sense of precision and detail in the carving. The base of the circular cavity contains small pebbles, contrasting with the smooth stone surface around it.](/assets/art/20220424-IMG_1491.jpg)

![A tall, cylindrical sculpture with a rough, natural surface on the lower half and a highly polished upper section. The top has a circular opening, creating the illusion of depth. The sculpture stands outdoors on a bed of rocks, surrounded by greenery, blending the rawness of nature with refined craftsmanship.](/assets/art/20220424-the-well.jpg "<i>The Well</i>, by Isamu Noguchi")

![A minimalist sculpture made from a thick, flat slab of black stone, resting on a single round stone. The surface of the slab features two shallow, oval-shaped depressions. The combination of geometric precision and organic material creates a balance between nature and human intervention.](/assets/art/20220424-water-table.jpg "<i>Water Table</i>, by Isamu Noguchi")
