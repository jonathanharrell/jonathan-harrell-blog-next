  ![This graphic combines text and a dark, textured background, with scattered particles resembling dust or snow. The text is written in thin, all-uppercase letters, with a poetic and fragmented message: "But black sin hath betrayed to endless night my worlds both parts." The contrast between the delicate white letters and the dark background adds to the dramatic mood, evoking themes of betrayal, darkness, and duality. In the bottom right corner, a caption reads: "'Scraping,' Multiple Exposure Digital Photograph, 2009," indicating that the image incorporates photography techniques. The overall effect is somber, introspective, and atmospheric.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-14.jpg)

  ![This minimalist graphic features thin, all-uppercase text that reads: "And O both parts must die," set against a mostly white background. On the left side of the image, faint particles or specks are scattered, adding a subtle texture to the otherwise clean design. A small caption at the bottom reads: "'To Dust You Shall Return,' High-Speed Digital Photograph, 2009," suggesting that the image connects to themes of mortality and impermanence. The simplicity of the design and the stark contrast between the text and the empty space create a somber, reflective atmosphere, with the message conveying a sense of inevitability and finality.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-17.jpg)

  ![This graphic features poetic text written in thin, all-uppercase letters against a dark background. The words read: "Pour new seas in mine eyes / Drown my world with my weeping earnestly." Below the text, a high-contrast image of water adds texture, with ripples and reflections glistening in the darkness. A caption at the bottom of the image reads: "'The Psychoanalysis of Water,' High-Speed Digital Photograph, 2008," indicating that the photograph plays a central role in the piece. The combination of the poetic text and the image of water evokes themes of sorrow, emotional depth, and reflection, with the visual elements amplifying the intensity of the words.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-18.jpg)

  ![This black-and-white image features a human face submerged or enveloped in swirling, turbulent water. The water flows chaotically, partially obscuring the facial features, creating a dreamlike or surreal effect. The light reflecting off the water adds to the intensity of the image, with sharp highlights and deep shadows emphasizing the motion of the liquid. The face appears calm or expressionless, contrasting with the violent movement of the water around it. The image evokes a sense of being overwhelmed, as though the person is immersed in or consumed by the water, symbolizing emotional turmoil or transformation.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-20.jpg)

  ![This graphic design features white text on a dark background. The words read: "Or wash it if it must be drowned no more," written in thin, all-uppercase letters. On the left side of the image, there is a high-speed digital photograph of water, its surface rippling and glistening with reflections in low light. The contrast between the flowing water and the clean typography gives the design a minimalist yet emotionally evocative tone, hinting at themes of cleansing, release, or resolution. A small caption beneath the text reads: "Untitled, High-Speed Digital Photograph, 2011," providing context for the accompanying visual element.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-21.jpg)

  ![This graphic design features the text: "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water. And yet for attacking things that are firm and strong, there is nothing that can take precedence of it. For there is nothing so effectual for which it can be changed." The typography is thin, geometric, and all in uppercase, laid out against a background of abstract water reflections or droplets, captured in high contrast with bokeh lighting effects. The combination of soft visuals and the philosophical text highlights the paradoxical power and fluidity of water, conveying themes of resilience and adaptability.](/assets/art/20111011-water-dreams-51.jpg)
