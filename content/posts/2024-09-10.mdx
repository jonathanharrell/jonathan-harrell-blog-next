![A serene night scene depicting a traditional Japanese building partially obscured by trees, bathed in soft moonlight. The sky is a gradient of deep blue, with a bright full moon illuminating the calm surroundings. Faint lights glow warmly from the windows of the structure, creating a contrast between the cool tones of the night and the gentle warmth within. The intricate silhouettes of the trees add depth and texture to the tranquil, atmospheric composition.](/assets/art/20240910-evening.jpg "<i>Evening scene at yushima</i>, by Komura Settai")
