![A colorful crest for the Ghibli Museum, featuring a whimsical design. The crest is divided into four quadrants: the top-left shows three flying birds, the top-right depicts a black boar, and the bottom section shows a tree with Totoro, a character from My Neighbor Totoro, peeking from below. Above the crest, a Catbus figure peers over with its wide yellow eyes. A pink banner reading "Ghibli Museum, Mitaka" wraps around the top. The crest is surrounded by green leaves, adding a natural and playful touch to the design.](/assets/art/20130919-scan-1.jpg)
