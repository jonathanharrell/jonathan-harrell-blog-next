![A tranquil sunset over a marshland with patches of water reflecting the soft light. The sky is a gradient of orange and yellow as the sun dips below the horizon. A flock of birds is in flight across the sky, adding movement to the peaceful scene. In the distance, silhouettes of trees and industrial structures, including a pair of tall chimneys, can be seen, contrasting with the natural landscape. The calm waters and open space evoke a serene and quiet atmosphere.](../../assets/photos/20190910-IMG_2736.jpg)
