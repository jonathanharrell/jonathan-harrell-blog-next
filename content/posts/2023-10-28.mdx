I saw a hole in the sky,<br/>
Gaping mouth of something nameless<br/>
Sucking in all the light,<br/>
Breathing out a cold, dead wind.<br/>
I pointed at it. I shouted.<br/>
Told everyone to look up.<br/>
But they went on as if nothing was there,<br/>
Kept their hollow eyes on the ground.<br/>
They never saw those awful teeth<br/>
Snarling just beyond the clouds.
