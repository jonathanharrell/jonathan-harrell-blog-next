Southern cedar summers.<br/>
Pine sap fingers<br/>
And honeysuckle smell.<br/>
In the lake,<br/>
The shadow of a horsefly,<br/>
The tickle of hydrilla<br/>
Against the soles of my feet.<br/>
A cicada chorus plays<br/>
As I watch the water bead<br/>
Against your neck,<br/>
As I watch the setting sun<br/>
Light up your raveled hair.
