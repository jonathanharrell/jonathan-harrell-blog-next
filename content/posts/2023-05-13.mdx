Southern cedar summers.<br/>
Pine sap fingers<br/>
And honeysuckle smell.<br/>
In the lake,<br/>
The shadow of a horsefly,<br/>
The tickle of hydrilla<br/>
Against the soles of my feet.<br/>
A cicada chorus plays<br/>
As I watch the water bead<br/>
Against your neck,<br/>
As I watch the setting sun<br/>
Light up your raveled hair.

The field is lush and green, and the house is surrounded by trees under a partly cloudy sky, evoking a sense of quiet rural life.](../../assets/photos/20230513-IMG_6002.jpg)

![The camera points upward to capture a patch of the sky framed by tall trees. The sun peeks through the branches, and the clouds in the blue sky create a peaceful and open feeling, with light and shadows playing between the leaves.](../../assets/photos/20230513-IMG_5982.jpg)
