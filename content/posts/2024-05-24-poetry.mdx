> I look around the backyard at all the places I love. The gnarled knuckles of the crab apple trees. The statue of Mary in the crescent of cedars I like to talk to. The place where only moss will grow. The ugly dog next door.<br/><br/>
> I ask my mother if she'd like to go for a drive. There's a loop—we're backing out of the driveway—it's taking a long time to happen. I'm nervous because I don't want to fight with her. The scene is stuck, she is not really there. I grab her by the arms. I'm shaking her. Yelling. Why isn't she seeing me. I feel overwhelmed yelling her name, Mom, over and over again. She pales, disappears and I'm left throwing a tantrum by myself.<br/><br/>

> Transfixed together. Rooted in a delicate, invisible repatterning of light.
