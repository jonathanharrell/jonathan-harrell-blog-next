A spore, a spawn, a seedâ€”<br/>
Something grows in the underbrush,<br/>
Mycelium through the rot of trees,<br/>
Weaving a tapestry of hyaline thread.<br/>
Later, after a night-cool rain,<br/>
A violent bloom erupts,<br/>
Dewy caps bursting out of wet-split bark,<br/>
Reaching, reaching for their taste of the sun.<br/>
