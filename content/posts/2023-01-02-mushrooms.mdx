A spore, a spawn, a seedâ€”<br/>
Something grows in the underbrush,<br/>
Mycelium through the rot of trees,<br/>
Weaving a tapestry of hyaline thread.<br/>
Later, after a night-cool rain,<br/>
A violent bloom erupts,<br/>
Dewy caps bursting out of wet-split bark,<br/>
Reaching, reaching for their taste of the sun.<br/>

![Shelf-like mushrooms in shades of brown and beige growing at the base of a tree surrounded by dry leaves. The colors of the fungi blend with the autumn tones of the forest floor.](/assets/photos/20230101-IMG_4410.jpg)

![A cluster of fan-shaped fungi, light brown with darker rings, growing tightly along the bark of a tree. The texture of the bark and the natural patterns in the fungi's growth create an intricate, layered effect.](/assets/photos/20230101-IMG_4421.jpg)

![A close-up of small, fan-shaped mushrooms with reddish-brown caps growing on a piece of decaying wood. The delicate ridges and earthy colors of the fungi contrast with the rough, dark bark.](/assets/photos/20230101-IMG_4476.jpg)

![A rugged rock face with layers of stone slanting sharply, leading into a tight crevice. The rock surface is streaked with various earthy tones, and the texture appears weathered and jagged. Bare trees are visible in the background against a pale sky.](/assets/photos/20230102-IMG_4615.jpg)
