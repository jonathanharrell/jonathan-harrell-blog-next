There is an old stone that still remembers<br/>
The salty, wet-moustached kiss of the sea,<br/>
Violent feather brush of white winged wind,<br/>
The copper-fleshed flare of the sun<br/>
In untempered jealousy.

![A night view looking up through an archway. The stone arch frames a dark, cloudy sky, and tree branches are faintly visible, illuminated by dim streetlights. A stone column stands near the edge of the frame, partially lit.](/assets/photos/20221116-IMG_3679.jpg)
