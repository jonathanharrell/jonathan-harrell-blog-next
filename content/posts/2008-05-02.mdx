Views from a dorm room window.

![This photograph captures a hazy, golden sunset over a town or campus. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a warm orange and yellow glow across the sky. The silhouette of a tall spire is visible against the fading light, and faint lights from buildings or streets can be seen in the distance. The image has a soft, blurred quality, with lens flare effects adding a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere. The combination of the warm sunset and the misty, out-of-focus foreground creates a tranquil, almost surreal mood.](/assets/photos/20070902-IMG_2185.jpg)
