When I stood beneath the moon,<br/>
I wept,<br/>
Knowing how perfect the moment was:<br/>
The silver air,<br/>
Waves swelling in the dark tides,<br/>
About to break,<br/>
Before they froze,<br/>
Like glass,<br/>
In my memory.

![This image captures a serene nighttime scene by the sea, with the moon casting a soft, glowing light over the water. The moonlight reflects on the calm ocean, creating a shimmering pathway on the surface. In the foreground, waves crash gently against dark rocks, their frothy white tips illuminated by the moonlight. To the left, a small house or lighthouse sits near the shore, with warm lights glowing softly in contrast to the cool, muted tones of the night.](../../assets/photos/20230930-IMG_6494.jpg)
