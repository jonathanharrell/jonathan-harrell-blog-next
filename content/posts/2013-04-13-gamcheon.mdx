A town where everything is made of color,<br/>
Even the rust of metal roofs—gold dust over indigo.<br/>
Plastic bird people sit perched, leaning over the eaves,<br/>
Watching the tourists with insensible smiles.

![This image shows a narrow, steep staircase winding between closely packed buildings in what appears to be an urban residential area. The buildings on either side are worn, with faded paint and exposed concrete, creating a gritty and authentic atmosphere. Some of the walls are painted in pastel hues like light blue and green, while utility wires crisscross overhead, further emphasizing the lived-in, informal character of the space. The staircase leads upwards, drawing the eye towards the upper levels of the buildings, which seem to rise haphazardly as if stacked upon one another. The overall scene has a sense of quiet solitude and the charm of an older, densely populated neighborhood.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4689.jpg)

![This image shows a whimsical display of brightly colored animal sculptures—perhaps birds or a mix of creatures—perched along the edge of a pastel green building's rooftop. The animals are painted in vivid hues such as yellow, red, blue, green, and black, creating a striking contrast against the light green building and the clear blue sky. The playful arrangement of the sculptures adds a sense of fun and creativity to the otherwise plain building, making it stand out as an artistic landmark. The architectural simplicity of the building contrasts with the boldness of the colorful figures, giving the scene an eclectic and lively atmosphere.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4654.jpg)

![This image features a decorative installation of circular ceramic plates or discs mounted on a gray textured wall. Each disc has concentric rings in various colors, such as red, green, blue, and brown, creating a visually striking pattern. The design on the wall resembles an abstract tree, with white lines connecting the discs, mimicking branches or stems. The vibrant colors and geometric shapes stand out against the muted gray background, giving the installation a modern, artistic feel. The overall effect is playful and creative, adding an element of visual interest to the otherwise plain wall.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4662.jpg)

![This image shows a row of brightly colored towels—mainly orange, white, and blue—hanging on a clothesline outside a building. The building has a brick facade, with various signs and air conditioning units visible on the walls. The towels sway slightly in the breeze, creating a casual and lively atmosphere. The vibrant colors of the towels contrast with the muted tones of the building and the sidewalk, drawing attention to the everyday simplicity of drying laundry in an urban alleyway. Small potted plants near the bottom of the image add a touch of greenery to the otherwise industrial setting, creating a warm, lived-in feel.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4771.jpg)

![This image shows a rooftop scene in an urban or residential area, with blue corrugated metal roofs dominating the composition. The roof in the foreground appears weathered, with yellowish debris or grains scattered across it, possibly drying in the sun. The wires crisscrossing between buildings add a sense of everyday life and utility to the scene. In the background, brightly painted walls, including a vibrant blue house with laundry hanging outside, suggest a lively neighborhood. The overall image has a casual, lived-in feel, with the bright colors providing a cheerful contrast to the mundane utility of the rooftops and buildings.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4777.jpg)

![This image features a reflection of the photographer in a scratched and graffiti-covered glass surface. The glass is marked with various scribbles, drawings, and writings, creating an abstract and chaotic pattern. The layered effect of the reflections and the markings gives the image a sense of depth and mystery, as the viewer can partially make out the photographer’s form behind the glass. The interaction between the viewer and the artwork through the reflection suggests themes of identity, perception, and interaction with urban spaces, where public markings become part of the visual landscape. The overall effect is a mix of personal and impersonal, as the reflective surface both reveals and obscures at the same time.](/assets/photos/20130413-IMG_4694.jpg)
