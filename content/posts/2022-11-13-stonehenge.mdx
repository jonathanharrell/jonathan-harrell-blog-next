When we find it, it is already old,<br/>
The work of long forgotten hands.<br/>
Of giants, maybe, or of gods.<br/>
Who else could have done such a thing?<br/><br/>
Whispering, wondering shadows.<br/>
There the sun rises, there it sets.<br/>
The stones remember, but they do not speak,<br/>
They do not tell us what they know.<br/><br/>
Shall we build a fire?<br/>
Shall we sit and listen in the dark?<br/>
I hear a call on the wind,<br/>
A voice that is not my own.<br/><br/>
Under the stones we sleep,<br/>
And our dreams are dark and strange.<br/>
I wake with a start, and I knowâ€”<br/>
We, too, will build here.
