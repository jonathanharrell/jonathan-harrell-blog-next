Already old, when we find them.<br/>
Already marked by a hundred winds,<br/>
Deep-grooved by a thousand hammering rains.<br/><br/>
The stones have long memories,<br/>
But they do not speak.<br/>
They do not tell us who brought them here.<br/><br/>
In the shadows of their circle,<br/>
Our dreams are dark and strange.<br/>
At night, I hear a voice crying,<br/>
“It is many miles from the West Woods.”
