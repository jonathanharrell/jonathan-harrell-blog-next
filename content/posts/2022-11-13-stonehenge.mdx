Already old, when we find them.<br/>
Already marked by a hundred winds,<br/>
Deep-grooved by a thousand hammering rains.<br/><br/>
The stones have long memories,<br/>
But they do not speak.<br/>
They do not tell us who brought them here.<br/><br/>
At night, we sleep on the long grass<br/>
In the shadows of their circle,<br/>
And our dreams are dark and strange.<br/><br/>
In the small hours, I hear a voice crying:<br/>
“It is many miles from the West Woods.<br/>
Many miles from Orcadie…”

![A wide-angle photograph of Stonehenge, the ancient stone monument, under a cloudy, overcast sky. The massive standing stones form a partial circle, with large horizontal lintels balanced on top of vertical stones. The surrounding landscape is a vast, green field, with a few distant figures scattered around, providing a sense of scale. The moody sky adds a dramatic atmosphere, evoking the mystery and timelessness of the site.](/assets/photos/20221113-IMG_3115.jpg)
