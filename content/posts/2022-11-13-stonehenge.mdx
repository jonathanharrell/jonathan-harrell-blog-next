Already old, when we find them.<br/>
Already marked by a hundred winds,<br/>
Deep-grooved by a thousand hammering rains.<br/><br/>
The stones have long memories,<br/>
But they do not speak.<br/>
They do not tell us who brought them here.<br/><br/>
At night, we sleep on long grass<br/>
In the shadows of their circle,<br/>
And our dreams are dark and strange.<br/><br/>
In the small hours, I hear a voice crying:<br/>
“It is many miles from the West Woods.<br/>
Many miles from Orcadie…”
