I live inside a metal throat,<br/>
Steel esophagus swallowing me down,<br/>
While I scramble to keep a view of the sky.<br/><br/>
I am a passenger in a metal beast.<br/>
I have eyes in its mouth,<br/>
But I canâ€™t really see much of the world<br/>
From this deep inside.

![A striking view looking upward through a geometric, multi-level structure with octagonal layers. The open sky above is framed by the copper-colored building, with its reflective surfaces leading the eye toward the blue sky and scattered clouds. The structure creates a sense of depth, with skyscrapers in the distance adding to the urban atmosphere. The contrast between the angular lines of the building and the soft, natural shapes of the clouds makes the scene feel both modern and expansive.](../../assets/photos/20220409-IMG_1451.jpg)
