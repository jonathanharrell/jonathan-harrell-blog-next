> He was a solemn and delicate little boy. [...]<br/>
The hole in his heart was not what killed him;<br/>
it was the way that his lungs had to labor<br/>
because of the defect. [...]<br/>
which was why<br/>
it was so delicious to him to be talking<br/>
to almost any adult about all there is to know.
