The story of Misurinaâ€”<br/>
A girl living forever beneath the water,<br/>
While her father weeps.<br/><br/>
We give the water ashes of our own dead,<br/>
And bless the perfect blue<br/>
That will keep him there, safe, forever.<br/>

Beyond the lake, a vast forest of evergreens stretches up towards a dramatic mountain range with craggy rock formations under a bright, clear blue sky.](../../assets/photos/20180623-IMG_1275.jpg)

In the distance, rugged mountain peaks with patches of snow tower over the landscape, under a sky filled with scattered clouds. The lake's edges are fringed with grassy marshes and vibrant green meadows.](../../assets/photos/20180623-IMG_1301.jpg)

In the background, lush green forests cover the slopes of mountains, and jagged peaks rise against a partly cloudy blue sky.](../../assets/photos/20180623-IMG_1315.jpg)
