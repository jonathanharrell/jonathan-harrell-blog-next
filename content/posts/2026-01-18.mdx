  <img src="/assets/art/20260118-star-clusters.jpg" alt="Abstract artwork on a black background featuring two clusters of pale, organic dots. The upper cluster is larger and denser, radiating outward from a bright center like a starburst or swarm, while a smaller, more diffuse cluster sits below it, appearing softer and more granular. The overall effect suggests cosmic forms or drifting particles against darkness." className="border border-neutral-300" />
