Cat eyes stare out between<br/>
Shop window neon,<br/>
Watching the streets change.<br/>
Nothing will be the way that it was.<br/>
Even the cat, in a few years,<br/>
Will be a different cat,<br/>
A new street reflected<br/>
In differently colored eyes.

![This image features a cat resting behind a window, seemingly inside a shop. The cat, with a calm yet slightly curious expression, is lying on a metal shelf, peeking through the glass at the world outside. In the foreground, part of a bright green neon sign is visible, partially obscuring the view of the cat. The background shows a glimpse of a city street with brick buildings and signage, giving the impression of an urban setting. The reflection on the glass also adds to the layered depth of the image, blending the interior of the shop with the outside scene.](../../assets/photos/20230423-IMG_5616.jpg)
