In South Korea for a new season of life.<br/>
Evening at Gwangalli Bridge.

![A scenic view of a large suspension bridge extending across a body of water during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset. The sky is mostly clear, with a few clouds illuminated by soft, golden light. A lighthouse stands on a small rocky peninsula near the shore, and in the distance, modern high-rise buildings are visible against a backdrop of low mountains. The foreground features a paved walkway along the water's edge, adding a serene and reflective quality to the image.](../../assets/photos/20120826-IMG_1698.jpg)
