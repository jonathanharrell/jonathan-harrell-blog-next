![This image shows a peaceful harbor with boats gently floating on the water. The sun is low in the sky, reflecting off the water's surface and casting a warm, shimmering light. In the foreground, a boat named "Zella Sue" is docked, with stacked crates and equipment on the pier. The scene evokes a sense of quiet activity in a coastal town, with the soft morning or evening light adding to the calmness.](/assets/photos/20231004-IMG_7332.jpg)
