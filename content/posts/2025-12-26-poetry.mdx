> When he, my father, closed his eyes<br/>
> and breath and his body became<br/><br/>
> a bridge he had left behind on a journey and<br/>
> they wheeled him down the stairs,<br/><br/>
> she, my mother, sprang after them.<br/>
> She cried out:<br/><br/>
> My name is<br/>
> inside his tongue. I need to get it back.
