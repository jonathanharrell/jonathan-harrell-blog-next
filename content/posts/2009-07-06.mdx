Illustrations for <i>The Stones</i>, a short story originally told by my grandfather.

![This pencil sketch depicts a weathered, hollow tree trunk lying on the forest floor, surrounded by scattered rocks and debris. The tree's twisted, gnarled branches extend outward, and its bark is worn, suggesting that it has been dead for some time. In the background, slender tree trunks rise vertically, creating a dense and sparse forest setting. The detailed shading of the hollow tree contrasts with the lighter, simpler lines of the surrounding trees, drawing attention to the decaying centerpiece. The image evokes a sense of stillness and decay, capturing the natural beauty of a forgotten woodland.](../../assets/art/20090518-stones.jpg)

![This pencil sketch depicts a close-up view of irregularly shaped stones piled together. The artist has used shading and texture to emphasize the depth and dimensionality of the stones, with light areas highlighting the smooth, rounded surfaces, and darker areas suggesting shadows between them. The stones vary in size and shape, some appearing more angular while others are smoother and more organic. The interplay of light and shadow gives the drawing a realistic and tactile quality, evoking the natural beauty of a stone arrangement.](../../assets/art/20090706-stones.jpg)
