I am floating<br/>
Over a cul-de-sac<br/>
Of impossible geometry.<br/>

I see our old house,<br/>
Under a streetlamp<br/>
Windows eye-like in the walls.<br/>

I float through the front door,<br/>
Into purple-shadowed rooms,<br/>
Into a dream inside a dream...<br/>

I wish, more than anything,<br/>
That I could go back there,<br/>
But<br/><br/>
There isnâ€™t any way to go home.
