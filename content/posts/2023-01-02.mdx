I am floating three feet off the ground,<br/>
Past houses with ghost-light windows,<br/>
Down to a cul-de-sac that spirals in on itself<br/>
With impossible geometry.<br/><br/>
This is where I grew up, I realize,<br/>
And then I see our old house,<br/>
Red brick colored by a purple streetlamp<br/>
Windows vacant and eye-like in the walls.<br/><br/>
I float through the front door,<br/>
Into purple-shadowed rooms,<br/>
Past plastic-sheathed furniture<br/>
And faces framed sharply along the hall.<br/><br/>
Down onto a violet quilt,<br/>
Down into a dream inside a dream...<br/><br/>
I wish, more than anything,<br/>
That I could go back there,<br/>
But the truth is this:<br/>
There isnâ€™t any way to go home.
