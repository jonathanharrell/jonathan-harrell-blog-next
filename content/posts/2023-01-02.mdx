I am floating<br/>
Over a cul-de-sac<br/>
Of impossible geometry.<br/>

I see our old house<br/>
Under a streetlamp,<br/>
Windows eye-like in the walls.<br/>

I float through the front door,<br/>
Into purple-shadowed rooms,<br/>
Into a dream inside a dream...<br/>

I wish, more than anything,<br/>
That I could go back there,<br/>
But<br/><br/>
There isnâ€™t any way to go home.

![A quiet suburban street at night, illuminated by a bright streetlamp casting a purple-hued glow over the scene. The soft mist in the air amplifies the color, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. Cars are parked along the street, and trees with dark silhouettes frame the view. Faint warm lights from houses peek through the branches in the background, contrasting with the eerie blue-purple light.](/assets/photos/20230102-IMG_4639.jpg)
