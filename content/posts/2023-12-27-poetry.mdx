> That night, in sleep, I saw the forest clearing<br/>
> by the moor’s edge, and the ring of his ashes.<br/>
> A skirl of smoke began to rise —<br/>
> bracken curling, a fume of blaeberry leaves.<br/>
> Ants broke their ranks, scattering, fleeing,<br/>
> and a moth spun ahead of the fire-wind.<br/>
> I took the path over the heath at a run.<br/><br/>
> A voice at my shoulder said, 'You’ll inherit fire.'<br/>
> And through the smoke I glimpsed a line of figures<br/>
> on the hillside, beating and beating the heather<br/>
> as the fire-front roared towards them.<br/>
> A volley of shouts: 'Keep the wind at your back!'<br/>
> My grandmother threshing with a fire-broom,<br/>
> Dad hacking a firebreak. My stillborn brother, now grown,<br/>
> sprinting for the hollow where the spring once flowed,<br/>
> the whole hill flaring in the updraft.<br/><br/>
> And there: a girl, running for the riverside —<br/>
> she wore my face, the shade of ash.
