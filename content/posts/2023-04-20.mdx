The best of us<br/>
Was a cherry blossom,<br/>
Flowering for a moment<br/>
In perfect sunlight,<br/>
Then scattered,<br/>
Like ashes<br/>
In an October wind.

The bright blue sky and patches of clouds provide a serene backdrop, while people walk underneath the canopy of blossoms in a sunlit garden.](/assets/photos/20230420-IMG_5304.jpg)
