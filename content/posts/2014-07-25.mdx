Quiet, quiet, said the storm.<br/>
I’m trying to tell you something...<br/>
A word, a thunderclap,<br/>
A strike of light across your eyes.<br/>
Listen, now. I’m trying to speak.<br/>
Don’t you know you are being driven<br/>
By great winds across the sky?

![A dramatic scene of storm clouds illuminated by flashes of lightning. The thick, dark clouds are backlit, creating a glowing, ethereal effect with soft gradients of light and shadow. The faint outline of a lightning bolt can be seen streaking through the clouds, adding intensity to the otherwise calm, moody atmosphere. The sky is a blend of dark purples and grays, giving a sense of the power and beauty of a storm in motion.](/assets/photos/20140725-IMG_4787.jpg)
