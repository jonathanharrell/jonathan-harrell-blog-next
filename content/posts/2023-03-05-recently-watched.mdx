> If there’s nothing else, there’s applause. I’ve listened backstage to people applaud. It’s like - like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up. Imagine, to know every night that different hundreds of people love you. They smile, their eyes shine, you’ve pleased them. They want you. You belong. Just that alone is worth anything.
