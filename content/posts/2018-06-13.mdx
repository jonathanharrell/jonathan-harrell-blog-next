There is a gilded chapel,<br/>
Sitting in long-grass woods,<br/>
Cross pointing to open sky.<br/>
I, though, love the nave of leaning trees,<br/>
Transept of fallen branches,<br/>
Holy altar of wind-carved stone.

The scene conveys a peaceful, natural setting with the architectural landmark subtly visible in the background.](/assets/photos/20180613-IMG_0156.jpg)
