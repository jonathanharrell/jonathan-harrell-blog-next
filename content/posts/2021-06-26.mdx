![A traditional ink painting of birds in a natural setting, rendered in a minimalist style. The painting features two larger birds in the foreground, drawn with expressive brushstrokes, and a smaller bird perched on one of their backs. The background includes abstract shapes and forms suggesting trees or foliage, all done in soft shades of black and gray. The simplicity and fluidity of the brushwork evoke a sense of calm and harmony with nature.](/assets/art/20210626-birds-in-lotus-pond.jpg "<i>Birds in a lotus pond</i>, by Bada Shanren")
