![A steep, industrial staircase spirals upwards inside a large, cylindrical concrete shaft. The metal stairway is sharply angled, creating a dramatic perspective that draws the eye toward the distant opening at the top. The walls of the shaft are smooth, and faint streaks of water stains run along the surface, adding texture to the otherwise stark surroundings. The lighting is minimal, with a single bare bulb casting shadows and emphasizing the utilitarian design of the structure.](/assets/photos/20140724-IMG_4716.jpg)
