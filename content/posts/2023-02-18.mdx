![A bird's-eye view of a busy city street intersection, with several yellow taxis and cars driving along the road. Pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalks, and the scene is framed by tall buildings, including glass-covered skyscrapers. The streets feature marked bike lanes and crosswalks, with traffic flowing smoothly. The cool tones of the photo, possibly taken during the early morning or late afternoon, create a calm urban atmosphere.](../../assets/photos/20230218-IMG_4862.jpg)
