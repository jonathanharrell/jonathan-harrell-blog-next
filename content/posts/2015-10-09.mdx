An alley can be beautifulâ€”<br/>
A narrowness of buildings,<br/>
Iron lattice of fire escapes,<br/>
The strange darkness of in-between,<br/>
Of on-your-way-to-somewhere-else.

![Dimly lit urban alleyway at night, surrounded by tall buildings with fire escapes on one side and windows glowing with light. The alley is empty, with trash bins near the far end, and the tops of skyscrapers rise into the night sky.](../../assets/photos/20151009-IMG_2368.jpg)
