I am here.

![This image shows two stacks of balanced stones, also known as cairns, placed on a rocky outcrop by the sea. The sky is overcast, with soft light casting minimal shadows, and the calm ocean stretches into the horizon in the background. The stones are rounded and weathered, likely shaped by natural forces such as water and wind. The cairns create a peaceful, meditative atmosphere, symbolizing balance and harmony with nature. The juxtaposition of the solid stones and the expansive sea enhances the sense of serenity in the image.](/assets/photos/20130120-IMG_5955.jpg)
