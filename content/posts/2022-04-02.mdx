I sit on my web and watch all the people,<br/>
I watch as the net bows and sags beneath their feet.<br/>
When I'm alone in the darkness I spin something new—<br/>
A little lie I can tell them when they ask me who I am.<br/><br/>
Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you the truth.<br/>
That would frighten you, and I don't want to do that.<br/>
Little lies are soft and gentle, they go down easy,<br/>
And I don't want you to hurt when you swallow down my words.
