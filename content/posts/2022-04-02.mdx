I sit on my web and watch all the people,<br/>
I watch as the net bows and sags beneath their feet.<br/>
When I’m alone in the darkness I spin something new—<br/>
A little lie I can tell them when they ask me who I am.<br/><br/>
Don’t worry, I’m not going to tell you the truth.<br/>
That would frighten you, and I don’t want to do that.<br/>
Little lies are soft and gentle, they go down easy,<br/>
And I don’t want you to hurt when you swallow down my words.

A bright light source in the center contrasts with the muted tones of the net and the dim space, creating an otherworldly effect.](/assets/art/20220402-IMG_1374.jpg "<i>Free the Air: How to hear the universe in a spider/web</i>, by Tomás Saraceno")

The lighting highlights the fragile web structure, casting a dramatic shadow against the dark background, making the web appear both ethereal and monumental.](/assets/art/20220402-IMG_1398.jpg "<i>Webs of At-tent(s)-ion</i>, by Tomás Saraceno")

The image evokes a sense of motion, resembling sparks or light trails moving swiftly through space, creating a feeling of energy and speed.](/assets/art/20220402-IMG_1414.jpg "<i>Particular Matter(s)</i>, by Tomás Saraceno")
