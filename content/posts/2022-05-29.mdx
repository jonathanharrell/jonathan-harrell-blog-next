We took the tunnel into the dead land,<br/>
Walked the long nave of concrete,<br/>
Following the old graffiti stains,<br/>
Until they disappeared beneath a web of lichen.<br/><br/>
At the end of the broken road<br/>
We saw a lonely huddle of buildings.<br/>
My feet felt something spongy—<br/>
Asphalt crumbling like stale cake.<br/><br/>
Listen, I said.<br/>
The wind speaks through the empty rooms.<br/>
Can’t you hear the children playing,<br/>
Running along this very corridor?<br/><br/>
A trick of the mind, you said.<br/>
Nothing more.<br/>
This place has turned hollow and silent,<br/>
And will never speak to us again.<br/><br/>
Then we came to the place of broken trees,<br/>
The tumbledown land under a dusting of spores.<br/>
I saw bones in the undergrowth and remembered,<br/>
How much I loved all that was buried there.
