![Cozy living room with sunlight streaming through stained glass windows. A dark couch is positioned against the windows, with a few plants on a side table and two lamps on either side. Wooden furniture and chairs complete the inviting atmosphere, with light filtering softly into the room.](/assets/photos/20141011-IMG_0401.jpg)
