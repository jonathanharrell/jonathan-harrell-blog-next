![A quiet and charming Venetian canal with a small arched pedestrian bridge crossing over the water. The narrow canal is lined with historic buildings, their windows adorned with flower pots. A boat is moored by the side, and the scene is bathed in soft sunlight under a clear blue sky.](/assets/photos/20180624-IMG_1495.jpg)

![A vibrant canal scene in Venice, with a motorboat cruising along the greenish water. On both sides of the canal are old, weathered buildings, some with faded facades and others painted yellow. Small balconies and shutters add character to the buildings. In the background, a church tower rises against a clear blue sky.](/assets/photos/20180624-IMG_1497.jpg)
