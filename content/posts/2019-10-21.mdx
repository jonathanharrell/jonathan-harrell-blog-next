Looking through the kitchen window,<br/>
Her hands turned pruny from dishwater,<br/>
She saw all the beauty of the world<br/>
In a ray of sunlight through the trees.

![A serene country road lined with tall trees on either side, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. The trees cast long shadows across the path, while their leaves are illuminated in shades of green and yellow. To the left, a fence runs alongside a grassy field, and in the distance, a small white building can be seen. The peaceful, sunlit scene evokes a quiet and tranquil rural setting.](../../assets/photos/20191021-IMG_3318.jpg)
