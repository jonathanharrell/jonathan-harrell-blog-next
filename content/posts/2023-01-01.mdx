We are lost satellites,<br/>
Free from our white-collar shackles,<br/>
The suffocating warmth of our mothersâ€™ milk.<br/>
Someday, we will burn in righteous fire,<br/>
Or drown in deep virtuous waters.<br/><br/>
For now, we whirl. We turn.<br/>
We let the stinging cold kiss our skin,<br/>
The raging fire blister our perfection.<br/>
Tonight is a free night, a dancing night,<br/>
And worth every unspeakable transgression.

In the center, a glowing light source, possibly the moon or a streetlamp, shines through the branches, creating a surreal and slightly abstract effect. The overall atmosphere feels ethereal and mysterious, with a blend of dark and warm tones against the twilight sky.](/assets/photos/20230101-IMG_4514.jpg)
