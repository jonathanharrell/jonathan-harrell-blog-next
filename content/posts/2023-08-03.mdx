![This image shows the Brooklyn Bridge, silhouetted against a setting sun. The sun peeks between the cables of the bridge, casting a warm glow over the scene. The American flag atop the bridge flutters in the breeze. In the background, the skyline of New York is visible, with some clouds overhead. The light of the setting sun and the faint lens flare create a calm, picturesque moment.](/assets/photos/20230803-IMG_6147.jpg)
