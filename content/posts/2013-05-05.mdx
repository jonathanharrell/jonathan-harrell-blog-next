On a Sunday...

Wading through city waves,<br/>
Towards the temple on the sea.<br/>
I see old trees curling themselves around the sun<br/>
To awaken their secret blooms.

The mussels cling to the jagged rocks, highlighting the marine life in this tidal zone. The scene captures the textures of the sea life and the rocky habitat by the ocean's edge.](../../assets/photos/20130505-IMG_6193.jpg)
