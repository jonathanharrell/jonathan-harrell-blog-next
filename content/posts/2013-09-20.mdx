Reflections at the Golden Pavilion,<br/>
Beside burning incense and an ocean of stones.

Chasing foxes at Fushimi Inari Shrine,<br/>
Where torii run endlessly away from me.

Kyoto sunlight striking over kanji,<br/>
Breaking through forests of bamboo.

Faces frozen in stone,<br/>
At peace or silently screaming,<br/>
Gnashing their moss-covered teeth.

I, like the fish, follow the sunlight,<br/>
And swim in the shadow of Nijo trees.

Where there are gates and demons, I turn away.

I follow the sunset path to Kiyomizudera,<br/>
And watch the shadows take Kyoto.

![A bustling street filled with people walking between traditional Japanese buildings. The sun sets in the background, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm glow. The street is lined with shops, and trees with green foliage frame the scene.](/assets/photos/20130920-IMG_1066.jpg)
