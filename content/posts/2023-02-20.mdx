From Cooper Hewitt, New York:

![An intricate architectural sketch of a Paris Métro entrance, drawn in a soft, flowing Art Nouveau style. The curves and swirls of the structure resemble organic shapes, with elegant, stylized lines creating a sense of movement and fluidity. The details suggest both mechanical elements and natural forms, blending geometry with artistry. Handwritten notes are visible at the top, providing details about the project, while the delicate pencil work emphasizes the design's complexity and grace.](/assets/art/20230220-paris-le-metropolitain.jpg "<i>Paris, Le Métropolitain</i>, by Hector Guimard")
