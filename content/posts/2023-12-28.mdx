Tonight, I am a boy again,<br/>
Treading air through the dark woods,<br/>
Trying to reach the Circle of Illumination,<br/>
Where I know I will be safe.<br/>
But I move slowly<br/>
Through molasses shadows,<br/>
As fingering terrors grope at my heels.<br/>
I try to scream—Mommy! Daddy!—<br/>
But a hand has reached down inside my throat<br/>
And taken everything that I am.
