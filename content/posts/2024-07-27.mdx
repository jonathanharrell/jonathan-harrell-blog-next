![A close-up photograph of an illuminated manuscript, featuring Latin text in gold leaf. On the left page, the text is faded and written on a purple background with decorative red borders. The right page has large, clearly visible gold letters with ornate, intricate decoration along the vertical margin. The craftsmanship emphasizes the luxurious and historical nature of the manuscript, with the text likely from a religious or classical source.](/assets/art/20240727-IMG_9800.jpg "<i>Gospel Book, in Latin</i>, France, Tours, Abbey of St. Martin")
