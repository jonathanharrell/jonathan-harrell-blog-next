The bluster and rain of Jiri Mountain.

![This image captures a misty forest scene, where fog envelops the trees and softens the landscape. The bare and sparsely-leaved trees fade into the thick mist, creating an ethereal and mysterious atmosphere. A narrow path winds through the forest, partially visible as it disappears into the fog. The soft lighting and the muted colors of the forest floor—along with the damp, mist-laden air—give the scene a quiet, almost haunting stillness. The image evokes a sense of solitude and introspection, as if one is walking through an isolated, dreamlike woodland.](../../assets/photos/20130420-IMG_6571.jpg)
