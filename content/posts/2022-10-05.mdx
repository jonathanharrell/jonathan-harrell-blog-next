Sun goes down over ocean,<br/>
Painting a gradient of longing,<br/>
Vibrantly outshining<br/>
The small orb of the moon.<br/><br/>
But her time will come.<br/><br/>
When I stand in the night tide,<br/>
She will turn all things to silver.<br/>
She will pull me down into dark waters<br/>
And softly cry me to sleep.
