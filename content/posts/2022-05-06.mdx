You are transparent.<br/>
I see the light through you.<br/>
The world looks better, somehow,<br/>
When I see it through your skin.<br/><br/>
I’m scared, though.<br/>
Scared that one day I’ll wake up<br/>
To find nothing but your afterimage<br/>
On the inside of my eyelids.

![A reflective, moody image of a man seen through a rain-streaked window at night. His face is softly illuminated by the lights outside, while the reflection of city streetlights, cars, and nearby buildings overlay his image. The wet streets and blurred motion of passing cars contribute to the dreamy, layered effect, blending the man's calm expression with the bustling urban scene outside. The image evokes a sense of introspection and solitude amidst the city’s activity.](/assets/photos/20220506-IMG_1591.jpg)
