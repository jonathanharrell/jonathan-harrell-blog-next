> don't be surprised: i'm a redneck wussy<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;moonshinesloppy with a limp wrist<br/>
> town crier sobbing on the street corner<br/>
> they'll get used to the lipstick<br/>
> same like the scupadine's fleshsweet pulp<br/>
> I'm here<br/>
> sure as roadkill&emsp;&emsp;sure as O<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; possum nightslick slurping bloodticks<br/><br/>
> i'm everywhere&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a dandelion falling apart<br/>
> in the wind's embrace&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; i'm haunting the family tree<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;born to this ecology&emsp;&emsp;this bloodied<br/>
> patch of dirt&emsp;&emsp;go ahead spit me roadside<br/>
> like a boiled peanut shell sucked of salt<br/><br/>
> crown me queen of the chitlin strut<br/><br/>
> don't be surprised the ground's so fertile<br/>
> young queers been fucking in the fields<br/>
> since the first sin&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;first garden delight<br/>
> first adam's apple taken in the mouth&emsp;&emsp;first seed spilled<br/><br/>
> if they bury enough wild queers in the dirt<br/>
> one's sure to sprout in their backyard
