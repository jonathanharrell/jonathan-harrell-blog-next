Sundown over Maplewood,<br/>
Light falling on the gravestones,<br/>
Sometimes catching a name or a D.O.D.<br/>
We used to play here,<br/>
Rolling down the hill on the east side,<br/>
Or hiding among the obelisks<br/>
Where no one else ever came.<br/><br/>
Hard to believe he’s here now,<br/>
Under one of these stones,<br/>
Just like all the rest.<br/>
Maybe someone will pass by and see<br/>
Dates that are too close together.<br/>
Maybe they’ll stand for a moment<br/>
And watch the sinking sun<br/>
Kiss the letters of his name.
