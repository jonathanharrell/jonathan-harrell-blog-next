In Hong Kong, in manicured gardens,<br/>
In parks where the middle-aged practice tai chi.

At temples where the incense is strong,<br/>
Where prayers float up like smoke.

There are fishing villages built on stilts,<br/>
Chaos of plastics and rusted metal.

And a cable car that carries us over the mountains,<br/>
Under the dying light of a hazy sun.
