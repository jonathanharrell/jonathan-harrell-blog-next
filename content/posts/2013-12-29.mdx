Winter runs through the stones at Taejongdae,<br/>
Chilling the strata, turning them blue.

![A balanced stack of smooth, rounded stones placed on a bed of gray pebbles. The central stone has concentric patterns, while smaller stones rest atop it, creating a simple yet natural sculpture.](../../assets/photos/20131226-IMG_2033.jpg)

There is sunfire on the heights of Mount Geumjeong.<br/>
The last of the year, before the chill comes,<br/>
And the world goes dark.

Cold winds blow over the sea.<br/>
Cold waves crash over the rocks.<br/>
Candlelight is all we have left.
