![A black-and-white photograph of an industrial street scene, likely from mid-20th century Britain. A group of children walk along a cobbled road flanked by looming factory buildings. Two tall smokestacks dominate the skyline, with one releasing a thick plume of black smoke. Railway tracks run parallel to the road on the right side, bordered by a stone wall. The image is atmospheric, with heavy contrast between the smoke-darkened sky and the silhouettes of industrial structures.](/assets/art/20250412-halifax.jpg "<i>Halifax</i>, by Bill Brandt")
