What the heart feels when the moon shines over Lake Baringo.

![A serene nighttime scene over a body of water, with the full moon rising above the horizon. The moon casts a reflective light on the water, creating a glowing path that stretches toward the viewer. Silhouettes of trees are visible in the foreground, and a small island can be seen in the distance. The sky is mostly clear with some clouds, adding to the tranquil, almost ethereal atmosphere of the image.](/assets/photos/20120703-IMG_9198.jpg)
