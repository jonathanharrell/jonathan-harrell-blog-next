![A surreal and unsettling painting of a humanoid figure with distorted facial features. The face appears melted or deformed, with hollow eye sockets, an asymmetrical mouth, and unusual textures resembling wax or decaying organic matter. The color palette includes muted greens, browns, and hints of white, giving the figure a ghostly, otherworldly appearance. The background is dark and indistinct, adding to the eerie, dreamlike atmosphere.](/assets/art/20250425-but-in-fact.jpg "<i>But in fact the glorious beings which they had produced were tortured by subtle imperfections beyond their makersâ€™ comprehension</i>, by Adolfo Bimer")
