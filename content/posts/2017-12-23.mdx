Out in the pine woods<br/>
He and I built a secret placeâ€”<br/>
A perfect shelter<br/>
Of branches<br/>
And rope<br/>
And a blue tarpaulin.<br/><br/>
In its shadow,<br/>
We'd whisper secrets,<br/>
Give each other names,<br/>
Let the rain wash over us<br/>
Without a single drop getting through.<br/><br/>
But we didn't hide that place well enough.<br/>
We went back to find it,<br/>
And it was gone,<br/>
Branches scattered,<br/>
Rope cut,<br/>
No sign of the tarpaulin.<br/><br/>
Secrets don't hold forever.<br/>
Not in those woods, at least,<br/>
And the knots I thought were tight enough<br/>
Didn't hold.
