Out in the pine woods<br/>
He and I built a secret place—<br/>
A perfect shelter<br/>
Out of branches<br/>
And rope.<br/><br/>
In its shadow,<br/>
We’d whisper secrets,<br/>
Give each other names,<br/>
Let the rain wash over us<br/>
Without a single drop getting through.<br/><br/>
But we didn’t hide that place well enough.<br/>
We went back to find it,<br/>
And it was gone,<br/>
Branches scattered,<br/>
Rope cut.<br/><br/>
Secrets don’t hold forever.<br/>
Not in those woods, at least,<br/>
And the knots<br/>
I thought were tight enough<br/>
Didn’t hold.

Wind chimes hang from the porch ceiling, and the surrounding landscape includes gravel paths, bare bushes, and a backdrop of trees beneath a cloudy sky.](/assets/photos/20171223-IMG_0010.jpg)
