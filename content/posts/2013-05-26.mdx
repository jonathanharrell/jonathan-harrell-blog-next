Jiri, a mountain of the gods.

We wake in early morning and climb under moonlight.<br/>
We wait for sunrise on the peak.

We walk the ridge where the wind is cold,<br/>
Where the pines and firs grow strong.

We stop and wade through cold mountain streams,<br/>
And add our own rocks to the city of cairns.
