![Aerial view of a grassy field with the shadow of a Ferris wheel cast on the ground. The shadow is partially obscured by a tree, with a few people standing in its shade. To the left, a parked car is visible. The bright sunlight and contrast create a playful scene, highlighting the Ferris wheel's circular form from an unseen vantage point.](../../assets/photos/20140614-IMG_8282.jpg)
