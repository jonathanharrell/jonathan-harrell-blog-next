Fractal spiral of branches.<br/>
Chorus of wind-chime leaves.<br/>
Pull me up into your canopy!<br/>
Let me float upon green-leaf airs.<br/>
I want to watch the world go by<br/>
From atop your emerald crown—<br/>
Far away, clean, in miniature.

![A wide, upward view of a tree from beneath, focusing on the sprawling branches that extend outward in all directions. The bright green leaves form a dense canopy, with sunlight shining through, creating a dappled effect on the leaves and branches. The tree’s large limbs create a natural, organic pattern against the bright green background.](/assets/photos/20240704-IMG_9683.jpg)

The sunlight filters through the lush green leaves above, casting soft light and shadows on the bark. The image emphasizes the texture of the tree bark and the dense canopy overhead.](/assets/photos/20240704-IMG_9690.jpg)
