> Here's the orchard someone else will tend to.<br/>
> And the crawl space beneath the porch<br/>
> of the house where someone else's barn cat<br/>
> will slumber through the summer nights<br/>
> dreaming of long-tailed mice in the high grass.<br/>
> Over that field, the light dips and refracts<br/>
> through the broken glass of the muck pond<br/>
> where a catfish will take someone else's bait<br/>
> and hook—that it might meet the refined<br/>
> heat of a skillet. The ghosts of a thousand<br/>
> head of cattle walk through the woods at night<br/>
> in someone else's dream while the windows,<br/>
> cracked slightly, let a mild breeze pass<br/>
> through the empty rooms like an appraiser.<br/>
> There is no death that cannot be undone<br/>
> by simply turning the compost with a pitchfork<br/>
> or by scattering scratch in the dirt for chickens<br/>
> who sing each time they lay, but every repair<br/>
> is only a gesture against the torment of slow<br/>
> winds and steady rain and heavy sun. It will be<br/>
> someone else who grows too old to climb<br/>
> the ladder into the barn's cool loft or the flight<br/>
> of stairs that lead to and from their own bed.<br/>
> It will be their hand weighing the mortgage.<br/>
> It will be their face forgetting its smile. Listen,<br/>
> if the well pump kicks to life at dawn, it will be<br/>
> someone else drawing a bath for the last time—<br/>
> joints relaxing as their form submerges, body<br/>
> recovering and failing in the same held breath.
