There is a special kind of fire<br/>
That only burns in the sky.<br/>
Flames of cloud and sunlight,<br/>
Warming, then purpling,<br/>
Then bruising blue and blackâ€”<br/>
The wounding of a day.

![A stunning sunset sky filled with dramatic clouds illuminated by golden and orange hues. The clouds are spread across the sky in various formations, with the light from the setting sun casting a warm glow on the lower portion of the clouds, creating a beautiful contrast against the darker, shadowed clouds higher up. The scene captures the peaceful and awe-inspiring beauty of a sunset.](../../assets/photos/20200902-IMG_3749.jpg)
