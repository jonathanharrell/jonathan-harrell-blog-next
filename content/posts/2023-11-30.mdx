Look! We made an electric tree.<br/>
Binary branching,<br/>
Node-hanging leaves,<br/>
Roots of copper and silicon weave.<br/>
Isnâ€™t it beautiful?<br/>
Perfection of circuitry.<br/>
So much better than our memory.

![This image shows a striking nighttime scene where a tree is illuminated by bright, glowing lights. The lights seem to trace the contours of the tree branches, creating an ethereal, almost otherworldly effect. Light rays stream through the scene, adding a sense of motion and depth, while the dark sky contrasts sharply with the luminous lines of the branches. The effect is dreamlike, as if the tree itself is radiating light or part of an art installation designed to highlight nature in a surreal, illuminated form. The mix of natural and artificial elements gives it a mystical, enchanted atmosphere.](../../assets/photos/20231130-IMG_8079.jpg)
