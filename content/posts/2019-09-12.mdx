The prison is empty<br/>
On the hill above the water.<br/>
Iâ€™m not afraid of ghosts, I think,<br/>
As I walk the old roads<br/>
And startle at every whispery sound.<br/>
The gulls, at least, seem happy to be here,<br/>
Finding their perch among the cells,<br/>
Looking out from behind bars<br/>
That no longer hold anything but secrets.
