The prison is empty<br/>
On the hill above the water.<br/>
Iâ€™m not afraid of ghosts, I think,<br/>
As I walk the old roads<br/>

The gulls, at least, seem happy to be here,<br/>
Finding their perch among the cells,<br/>
Looking out from behind bars<br/>
That no longer hold anything but secrets.

Sunlight filters through the empty windows, casting long shadows on the weathered walls.](/assets/photos/20190912-IMG_3010.jpg)
