From the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York:

![A single glass sphere floating against a dark, softly blurred background, reflecting light and shadow like a distorted interior room, creating a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere.](/assets/art/20260124-eye.jpg "<i>The Eye That Sees Everything</i>, by Man Ray")

> ...marvelous explorer of those aspects that our retinas will never record...

![Abstract spiral forms resembling layered ribbons or shells, rendered in smooth gradients of light and shadow, creating a flowing, sculptural composition on a dark background.](/assets/art/20260124-rayograph-1.jpg "<i>Rayograph</i>, by Man Ray")

![Surreal abstract shapes in pale tones forming a ghostly, organic silhouette, with a glowing oval form beneath and shadowy contours suggesting movement and depth.](/assets/art/20260124-rayograph-3.jpg "<i>Rayograph</i>, by Man Ray")

> Dreams, dreams, dreams, the domain of dreams expands with every step...

![Geometric triangular shapes in a repeating row resembling stylized mountains, beneath a glowing circular orb in a dark sky, evoking a minimalist, dreamlike landscape.](/assets/art/20260124-rayograph-6.jpg "<i>Rayograph</i>, by Man Ray")

> ...strange, troubling blurs...

![Abstract composition of soft, overlapping light and shadow forms, with a horizontal dark band cutting across the image, creating layered depth and a misty, atmospheric effect.](/assets/art/20260124-rayograph-7.jpg "<i>Rayograph</i>, by Man Ray")
