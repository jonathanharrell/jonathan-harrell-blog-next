> In our room a forest<br/>
> of breath—yours, mine, hers.<br/>
> Blue scrim, night's shadow cast over us.<br/><br/>
> Still, the breath is light<br/>
> and her night noises—little birds<br/>
> escaping the cage of her small lungs.<br/><br/>
> They fly—alight—around the room.<br/>
> Her moans and sighs, her coos perch<br/>
> on the ceiling fan.<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;I pluck them off one by one,<br/>
> cup them, say:<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;Shh, come down.
