> The new bruise<br/>
> on her neck darkened<br/>
> like a dead flower, her voice<br/>
> a coffin to carry her dead.<br/>
> & another friend⸻ & another friend⸻<br/>
> & today, a new flower grows in my backyard,<br/>
> & I blow the dust off the videotapes,<br/>
> & today, my mouth is still wide open.
