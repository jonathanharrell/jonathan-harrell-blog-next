The night dark of Brooklyn,<br/>
Dirty amber streets,<br/>
Trains running down deep green.<br/>
We are all living things,<br/>
Under the metal violence of wheels,<br/>
Cold tumble of rusted steel,<br/>
Old tiles that fall into a grind of dust.<br/>
I feel a grinding in my chest,<br/>
A rumble under my feet.<br/>
But I'll keep walking.<br/>
I'll go down dark under deep.<br/>
I'll keep running fingers over black tile teeth<br/>
Until all the skin there is gone.
