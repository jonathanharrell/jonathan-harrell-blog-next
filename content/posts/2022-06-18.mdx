Cybernated creature<br/>
Slouching towards the Electric Square,<br/>
To be born.<br/>
It has claws in all our fingers.<br/>
It has sunk its teeth<br/>
Into the whites of our eyes.<br/>
We cannot destroy it.<br/>
We love it too much.<br/>
Some days, I think,<br/>
We love it more<br/>
Than we love ourselves.
