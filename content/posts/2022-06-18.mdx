Cybernated creature<br/>
Slouching towards the Electric Square,<br/>
To be born.<br/>
It has claws in all our fingers.<br/>
It has sunk its teeth<br/>
Into the whites of our eyes.<br/>
We cannot destroy it.<br/>
We love it too much.<br/>
Some days, I think,<br/>
We love it more<br/>
Than we love ourselves.

![A dynamic, abstract image featuring swirling streaks of light and blurred colors against a dark background. The central focus appears to be a distorted, reflective surface, possibly a metallic object, illuminated by warm and cool tones of light. The circular motion creates a sense of energy and fluidity, giving the impression of rapid movement or a vortex-like effect, while the surrounding lights add a futuristic, dreamlike quality.](/assets/photos/20220618-IMG_2228.jpg)
