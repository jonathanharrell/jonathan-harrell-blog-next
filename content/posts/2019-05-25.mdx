The water comes close.<br/>
Every year it comes closer.<br/>
I feel the pull strong,<br/>
Back out sea-side.<br/>
One day the tide comes<br/>
And Iâ€™ve got nothing to hold on to.<br/>
I keep thinking of an old shore,<br/>
Long gone washed away.

![A peaceful beach at sunset, with soft waves gently lapping at the shore. The sandy beach is bathed in a warm golden light, with footprints scattered across the sand. Grassy dunes rise on the right side of the image, while the calm water stretches out to the horizon. The sky is clear, with soft pastel hues of orange and pink fading into the blue as the sun sets, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere.](../../assets/photos/20190525-IMG_2298.jpg)
