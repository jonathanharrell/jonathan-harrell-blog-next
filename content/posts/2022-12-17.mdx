All through the garden<br/>
Went gentle-feathered light,<br/>
Split colors on concrete diffusion,<br/>
Inverted shadow of a bird in flight.

![A bright, illuminated outline of a bird in flight, projected onto a dark pavement. The shape of the bird is sharply defined, and the edges of the light create a glowing, rainbow-like effect, adding a surreal and vivid quality to the image. The contrast between the dark ground and the luminous bird form is striking.](/assets/photos/20221217-IMG_4044.jpg)
