A stone is a stone is a stone.<br/>
Should I be a round one, worn down,<br/>
No edges or burrs or sharpness,<br/>
Nothing for the light to catch on to?<br/>
Or should I stick out, stick up,<br/>
Sit special like I've got something to say?<br/>
I know the answer, if I'm honest.<br/>
I wish I could smooth out all my rough edges,<br/>
Shine slick and smooth like a river stone.<br/>
But it would take years for the water to wear me down,<br/>
And I'm not sure I've got that kind of time.
