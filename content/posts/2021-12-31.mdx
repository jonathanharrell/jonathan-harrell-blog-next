A stone is a stone is a stone.<br/>
Should I be a round one, worn down,<br/>
No edges or burrs or sharpness,<br/>
Nothing for the light to catch on to?<br/>
Or should I stick out, stick up,<br/>
Sit special like I’ve got something to say?<br/>
I know the answer, if I’m honest.<br/>
I wish I could smooth out all my rough edges,<br/>
Shine slick and smooth like a river stone.<br/>
But it would take years for the water to wear me down,<br/>
And I’m not sure I’ve got that kind of time.

The stones vary in shades of gray and brown, with some showing cracks and imperfections. The background is slightly blurred, drawing focus to the texture and natural arrangement of the stones and surrounding foliage. The overall scene conveys a quiet, earthy atmosphere.](../../assets/photos/20211231-IMG_0784.jpg)
