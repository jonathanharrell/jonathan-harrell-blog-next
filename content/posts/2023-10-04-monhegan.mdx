We came ashore on Monhegan,<br/>
A foul landing on the Shattering Rocks.<br/>
We watched in silence as the old boat rusted,<br/>
And our lovely bodies turned to salt.

Remember us, when you show your face to the sun<br/>
For we, too, dearly loved the world.<br/>
We are all part of the Living Water,<br/>
Whose tides drown us each in our time.
