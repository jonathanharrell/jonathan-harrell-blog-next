> When two men kissed there used to be danger.<br/>
> On television where there there once was danger, there is now vibrant color.<br/>
> Color bursts & vibrates on screen, even if no one is there to see it.<br/>
> Have you ever seen something that buzzes inside you?<br/>
> I am watching two kids encounter each other with pure admiration.<br/>
> Television shows me alternate pasts in technicolor.<br/>
> Glimpses of the past will make you imagine safety where there isn't any.<br/>
> Tense is a lie, what is your present is someone else's future.<br/>
> A show I adore made me feel like we were living in a warm, pleasant future:<br/>
> Two high  school boys go on a date & their parents know.<br/>
> A boy I adore takes me back to my adolescent past.<br/>
> Most days I can distinguish between my own experience & a character's.<br/>
> Some days my own adolescence feels as if it were extinguished.<br/>
> A me I loved's past is disappeared, so I fill it with my guts.<br/>
> I am watching two boys kiss on screen & for once there is no secondhand shame.<br/>
> There are flames there. Right here there are burning flames.
