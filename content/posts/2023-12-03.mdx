From the Museum of Modern Art, New York:

![A cubist still life featuring a white, pedestal fruit bowl holding green fruits, with additional fruits scattered around the base. The background is abstract, with folds of white cloth and geometric forms in brown and grey tones. The shapes of the fruits and the bowl are slightly distorted, characteristic of the cubist style, giving the scene a fragmented and multi-dimensional appearance.](/assets/art/20231203-fruit-dish.jpg "<i>Fruit Dish</i>, by Pablo Picasso")

![An abstract painting depicting a mysterious night scene with a house surrounded by swirling wind and dark clouds. The house has two brightly lit windows showing figures inside, and large dark shapes loom overhead, possibly symbolizing trees or storm clouds. The overall palette is dark and muted, evoking a sense of isolation or eerie calm.](/assets/art/20231203-the-night-wind.jpg "<i>The Night Wind</i>, by Charles Burchfield")

![A cubist painting of a seated woman with exaggerated, angular body parts, including large feet, a stylized face, and prominent geometric breasts. Her body is composed of overlapping planes and sharp shapes, rendered in shades of brown, white, and muted colors, set against a dark green background. The woman appears to be adjusting her hair, with one arm raised and bent.](/assets/art/20231203-woman-dressing-her-hair.jpg "<i>Woman Dressing Her Hair</i>, by Pablo Picasso")

    <img src="/assets/art/20231203-miro-1.jpg" alt="A surrealist black-and-white lithograph featuring abstract, whimsical figures. A large, central figure with an oversized head and three eyes holds a star-like shape with one hand. Smaller abstract shapes and lines surround the figure, including a crescent moon, stars, and a figure on the right with wide, circular eyes. The overall style is playful and dreamlike, with geometric and organic forms blending together." />
    <img src="/assets/art/20231203-miro-2.jpg" alt="A black-and-white surrealist lithograph showing a large, rounded central figure with an abstract, bulbous body and extended arms. Surrounding the central figure are a variety of small abstract symbols, including eyes, stars, and organic shapes, giving the impression of a dreamlike, otherworldly scene. The use of large black shapes contrasts with finer lines and details scattered throughout the composition." />

![This image captures an abstract rendering of architectural forms. Simple geometric shapes, rendered in muted, earthy tones, overlap and suggest buildings or structures. The composition has a soft, dreamlike quality, with the edges of the shapes blending into one another.](/assets/art/20231203-buildings.jpg "<i>Buildings</i>, by Helen Torr")

![This painting depicts a group of people in light-colored hats and coats, their backs turned toward the viewer, as they gaze into a dark, ominous sky. The muted tones of the landscape and the figures create a mysterious and foreboding atmosphere, suggesting anticipation or contemplation of something unseen in the distance.](/assets/art/20231203-expectation.jpg "<i>Expectation</i>, by Richard Oelze")

![This artwork seems to be a minimalist, textured piece, with small, repetitive patterns creating a tactile surface. The subtle monochromatic palette of whites and grays allows the focus to fall on the material's texture, giving it a quiet, meditative quality.](/assets/art/20231203-no-f.jpg "<i>No. F</i>, by Yayoi Kusama")

![The second image showcases a dynamic abstract painting. It consists of bold, sweeping black brushstrokes on a pale background, with drips and splatters that evoke a sense of raw energy and movement. The painting appears spontaneous, with chaotic lines that create an intense and expressive composition.](/assets/art/20231203-work.jpg "<i>Work</i>, by Saburo Murakami")

![This image features a delicate art installation of net-like structures or canopies, each suspended from the ceiling. They seem to float in the air, with translucent layers and soft, subtle colors. The overlapping shadows on the wall create a feeling of depth, adding to the sense of weightlessness and gentle movement in the space.](/assets/art/20231203-IMG_8319.jpg "<i>Spiral for Shared Dreams</i>, by Carolina Caycedo")
