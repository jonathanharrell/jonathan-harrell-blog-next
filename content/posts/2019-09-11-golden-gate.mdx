![A view looking up at one of the tall towers of a red suspension bridge. The thick cables run along the tower, which stands against a backdrop of blue sky and soft clouds or mist. The sunlight casts shadows, adding depth to the architectural features of the tower.](../../assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2857.jpg)

![A close-up, upward view of a massive red tower of a suspension bridge. The riveted steel beams and weathered surface of the tower are bathed in sunlight, with cables extending from the structure into the clear blue sky above. The sheer size and industrial details of the tower dominate the image.](../../assets/photos/20190911-IMG_2894.jpg)
