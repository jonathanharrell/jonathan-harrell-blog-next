> On Christmas Eve, I heard<br/>
> the voice of God. It was clear<br/>
> and loud and sounded like<br/>
> my own voice when it ventures<br/>
> into the outside world<br/>
> and croaks a <em>good morning, sunshine</em>.<br/>
> But I don't worship anyone<br/>
> or anything except the sea<br/>
> and the mountains and they will<br/>
> kill me eventually, and I will die willingly.<br/>
> That is my only prayer.<br/>
> In my notebook from that day<br/>
> is written this: not every experience<br/>
> is worth recording; I am<br/>
> more cage than bird; reverence,<br/>
> I am writing with reverence.
