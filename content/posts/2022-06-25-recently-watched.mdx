> O what Protean forms swim up from men’s minds, and melt in hot Promethean plunder, scorching eyes, with divine shames and horror... And casting them down to Davy Jones. The others, still blind, yet in it see all the divine graces and to Fiddler’s Green sent,where no man is suffered to want or toil,but is... Ancient... Mutable and unchanging as the she who girdles ’round the globe. Them’s truth.
