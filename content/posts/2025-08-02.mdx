From the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York:

![Pastel and pencil drawing of an expansive evening sky over a darkened landscape. The sky is filled with swirling, radiating lines in soft yellows, browns, and muted blues, creating a dynamic, almost hypnotic texture that suggests wind or motion. Silhouetted trees and bushes line the horizon, emphasizing the vastness and movement of the sky above. The atmosphere is calm yet intense, capturing the fleeting light of dusk.](/assets/art/20250802-evening-sky.jpg "<i>Evening Sky</i>, by Nils Kreuger")
