![A painting of a dense, stylized forest with tall, slender trees reaching toward the sky. The forest floor is dotted with rounded bushes and tree canopies, creating a layered effect of greenery. In the background, softly lit hills and a golden-yellow sky give the scene a serene, autumnal feel. The composition emphasizes the vertical lines of the tree trunks contrasted with the soft, rounded foliage and distant hills.](/assets/art/20240727-autumn-evening.jpg "<i>Autumn Evening</i>, by Eyvind Earle")
