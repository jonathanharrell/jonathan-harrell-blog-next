Go to the wilderness, they told him.<br/>
Go there to meet God.<br/>
But when he went,<br/>
He built a mansion in his own image,<br/>
And no one stayed his hand<br/>
When he sacrificed all their sons.<br/><br/>
An Estate,<br/>
They called it in polite company.<br/>
A Second Estate.<br/>
He always fancied himself French, after all.<br/>
Did he imagine the eye of a needle<br/>
Was as wide as those limestone arches?<br/>
Or did he really care for no kingdom but his own?

![A beautiful outdoor corridor of a grand building, featuring tall, stone arches and intricate carvings at the top of each column. The ceiling is decorated with a woven, basket-like pattern. Beyond the arches, a clear view of a bright blue sky with a few wispy clouds reveals distant mountain peaks and a forest of leafless trees in the foreground. The scene feels serene, offering a blend of architectural elegance and natural beauty.](/assets/photos/20220313-IMG_1126.jpg)
