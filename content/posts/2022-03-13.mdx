Go to the wilderness, they told him.<br/>
Go there to meet God.<br/>
But when he went,<br/>
He built a mansion in his own image,<br/>
And no one stayed his hand<br/>
When he sacrificed all their sons.<br/><br/>
An Estate,<br/>
They called it in polite company.<br/>
A Second Estate.<br/>
He always fancied himself French, after all.<br/>
Did he imagine the eye of a needle<br/>
Was as wide as those limestone arches?<br/>
Or did he really care for no kingdom but his own?
